A relatively large site I created using C#/dotNET ASP.NET MVC framework to allow students to perform self-evaluations, by evaluated by their professors, view their results in comparison to others, leave reflections at the end of their semester, and more.

Uses authentication to ensure users are in the active directory as well as in our database (students and evaluators are uploaded to ensure they should be using this 
application).

Database connection via SQL using Entity Framework models and DbContext connection. The GetDbItems and SetDbItems in the /classes subdirectory are used as an easy
abstraction for getting and setting database items. 



I am unsure why it says the large part of this project is written in CSS, I have even deleted most CSS files but it still says the same.
